*   We need to organize data to turn into information. There are alot of tools out there that helps share data through visualization to stakeholders. There are two types od data visualization

1.  Raport 

    Static collection of data. High level historical data for an organization.
    Easy to design. They reflect data that already been cleaned and sorted. High maintenence

2.  Dashboard

    *   Dynamic, automatic, interactive. Because they´re dynamic, they have long term value. Low maintenence

*   Pivot table :

    A data summarization tool that is used in data processing. Pivot tables are used to summarize, sort, reorganize, group, count, total or average data stored in a database.

* Dashboard, dynamic information. Using tableau for example. 

##  Metrics

*   Are useful to turn data into useful information. Data raw is a collection of facts, until we organize in smallest pieces that are called metrics. ROI uses metrics for example.

##  Metric goal

*   Measure goal
